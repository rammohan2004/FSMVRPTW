# PARAM Rudra User Manual, p.39: "Compilations are performed on the login node.
# Only the execution is scheduled via SLURM on the compute nodes." The compute
# nodes carry no compiler at all -- jobs 613144/613150 both died on
# `g++: command not found` while trying to build here.
#
# This is a CPU / OpenMP solver, so it belongs on the 'small' partition, NOT on
# sgpu. Per the PARAM Rudra login banner:
#
#   small*  1 - 48 cores    2-00:00:00   3 running / 7 queued per user
#   sgpu    1 core / 1 GPU  2-00:00:00   1 running / 2 queued per user
#
# small is the cluster default, allows up to 48 cores, and permits three
# concurrent jobs rather than one -- so solver runs need not queue behind the
# cuOpt jobs.

# 180 is best on 1,000 customers, but it does NOT scale. Clarke-Wright merges
# only within a cluster and its merge loop is ~O(R^3) in the customers per
# cluster, so halving the cluster count multiplies the work eightfold:
#
#   customers  angle  clusters  per cluster   relative work
#      1,000    180       2          500          1x   (measured ~65 s seq)
#     10,000     30      12          833         28x
#     10,000    180       2        5,000      1,000x
