# 180, per Dinesh's observation that it beats every other angle -- confirmed here

# on route count; a wider angle means fewer, bigger clusters and more room to
# consolidate. The price is runtime -- the merge loop is ~O(n^3) per cluster.
# NB: results at different angles are not comparable, so changing this
# invalidates earlier baselines.
